The link to the contest \"https://codehawks.cyfrin.io/c/2025-04-eggstravaganza\")\nThe total number of bug in this ``Eggstravaganza `` first flight is 10( includes 2 High, 4 Medium, 4 Low. But I only found 1 medium and 2 low), which is really make me upset. But in the other side, it means there are too many things I can learn from this contest.\n\n1. Ownership check is essential in all kinds of code ( includes access control, ownership seperation in different contracts ...etc\n\nalways remember to determine who should or shouldn't access this function. How large the disaster can be when  a melicious person use the wrong/miss ownership vulnerability\n\n2. It leaves a vulnerability when interact with ERC721 using _mint instead of using _safeMint/ using transferFrom instead of using safeTransferFrom.\n\nIn summary, you should always remeber to consider a bad situation that the recipient not set the ERC721 receiver interface correctly. The NFT would loss if the address couldn't handle the NFT.\n",
